"""docs/llms.txt drift gate — the fifth contract artifact (badge-canon §3).

Scope note: this module has no schema/flows/errors triad emitter and no
capabilities.json emitter either — docs/capabilities.json here is
HAND-AUTHORED (see the Makefile `contract` comment; git log: "author
capabilities.json for the stapel-catalog sweep") and is committed by hand,
never regenerated. This test file gates ONLY docs/llms.txt, which renders
deterministically from that committed capabilities.json — no Django, no
subprocess, no regeneration of anything else.

Regenerate after any change to docs/capabilities.json:

    make contract        # or: python -m stapel_tools.llms_txt . --out docs

then commit ``docs/llms.txt``. Without regenerating, the drift gate below
fails.
