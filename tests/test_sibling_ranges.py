"""The sibling-range policy, pinned so a future tighter cap fails CI.

Architect's ruling, 2026-09-11:

    A COMPOSITE library depends on its `stapel-*` siblings with a floor and
    `<1.0` only; compatibility with a new sibling minor is proven by the
    composite's own CI installing the NEWEST sibling in range, and by the
    fleet's joint-resolution gate before any image build — not by a cap.

Why the rule needs a gate rather than a comment: this package holds no logic
of its own, only a combination of member versions, and for release after
release the combination was the WALL. `<0.23` on stapel-categories and `<0.7`
on stapel-reviews each answered a fleet image build with
`ResolutionImpossible`, and each cost a cap-only release of this package AND
of stapel-classified before anything could be built. The house pre-1.0
rule — minor = breaking — still governs LEAF libraries, which is where a cap
buys something: a leaf caps a dependency it actually calls. A composite calls
nothing; capping every sibling at the next minor only guarantees that the
composite expires the moment any one of its siblings ships a minor.

So the upper bound stops being an assertion about compatibility and the CI
`newest-siblings` leg starts being one. This test keeps the two from drifting
apart: reinstate a tighter cap and it fails here, with the ruling's sentence.
